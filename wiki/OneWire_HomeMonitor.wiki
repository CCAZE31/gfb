= Introduction =

A project to have arduino managed onewire thermometers around the house. Eventually I'll have a cron job to query the arduino nic (wiznet) and graph the data, but for now just stumbling through onewire network issues.


= Details =

===Hardware:===
 * [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove Arduino Duamillanove] - Make sure to get the version with the Atmega328, the extra memory is required with later versions of the code.

 * [http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=17_21&products_id=83 Adafruid etherShield] - Well designed shield kits, make life easy :)

 * [http://wiznet.co.kr/en WizNet WIZ811MJ Ethernet module] - Nothing special here, though I haven't used the other ethernet modules.

 * [http://www.maxim-ic.com/products/1-wire/ Maxim-IC DS18B20, DS18S20, DS18B20P one-wire thermometers] - Stick with the DS18B20 or DS18B20P version, the DS18S20 is not really worth the trouble.

 * [http://www.hobby-boards.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25_28&products_id=48 Hobby-Boards temp circuit boards] - These are really nice though I wish they werent restricted to parasite power for the ds18's :(

 * [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=462 Sparkfun 4x20 LCD w SerLCD backpack] - Pretty nice serial interface to the HD44780 on the lcd

 * Cat5e cabling in my walls...

===Software:===
 * Slightly modified [http://milesburton.com/index.php?title=Dallas_Temperature_Control_Library Dallas Temp Library], sent them my changes, lets see if they get added :)

 * [http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/SparkFunSerLCD SparkFunSerLCD Library]

 * [http://code.google.com/p/tinkerit/source/browse/#svn/trunk/Ethernet2 Ethernet2 Library] - This is older than the current arduino Ethernet library but seems to work better. Not sure whats going on here :(
